## Data Analysis with Excel

### Scenario
I'm a new marketing manager of an established Bicycle company. The company sells bicycles and accessories, such as clothing and other accessories to bikers in six countries.

The company has just hired Lucy as its new Sales manager. I'm tasked to introduce Lucy to the company, its product portfolio and its sales performance since 2011. To do this, I should ask Jack, the IT manager to prepare some data for me.

Below, we will do some labs, quizzes, and answer to the questions.

## Lab 1
Download the lab file [Lab1Start v5.xlsx](https://github.com/SomonOlimzoda/DataAnalysisExcel/blob/main/Lab1Start%20v5.xlsx) to answer the questions below.

The first thing I'd like to do is to present the data graphically. I do this by creating charts for the three groups of data I received from Jack, IT manager and give each chart a descriptive title as shown in the three charts below.

Your first solution should look like this [where numbers may not be the same](https://github.com/SomonOlimzoda/DataAnalysisExcel/blob/main/1.png).

For the **Yearly Category Revenue** chart, display the total revenue for each year as a separate line.

### Answer the following questions:

#### Question 1

What does the Yearly total sales look like?

#### Question 2

What does the Yearly total sales look like?

#### Question 3

Rank the Countries from the highest to lowest revenue. (Highest in Zone 1, Lowest in Zone 6)

How many rows are displayed (what is the record count)? Do not include thousands separator (for example commas or semi-colons).

### Scenario

While my first attempt to show the company's performance to Lucy was not bad, clearly she has a lot more requirements than what you provided. She wants to know more about the year over year sales, sliced into different categories, sub-categories, and countries. She also wants to see additional information such as customer demographics.

Jack has provided me with a different data source. This time the data has more than one hundred thousand rows. 

Before I can create additional reports to Lucy, first I need to prepare the data.

## Lab 2

Download the lab file [Lab2Start v5.xlsx](https://github.com/SomonOlimzoda/DataAnalysisExcel/blob/main/Lab2Start%20v5.xlsx) to answer the questions below.

The first thing you need to do is to convert the data into an Excel table.

Once you do that, you can add total row, filter the data, and the total will reflect the total only for the filtered data.

#### Question 1

What is the total revenue for all the sales in the United States?

#### Question 2

What is the total revenue for all the sales in the month of December?

#### Question 3

What is the total revenue for all the sales for Young Adults Age Group?

#### Question 4

What is the total revenue for all the bikes with frame size 62 for the customer age group Seniors?

#### Question 5

What is the total profit for United States sales in the month of October 2015, for customer age group Adults?
